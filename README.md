Features:
Parses top 8 players and displays them in a horizontal fashion. Good for minimal HUD layouts.
Automatically hides when combat is inactive.
Based off of RainbowMage's base parsing overlay.

To Use:
1. Download files and place them somewhere together.
2. Add path to rowparse.html to RainbowMage's Overlay Plugin.
3. If your parser does not use "YOU" to identify your character, change the playerNameToken variable in rowparse.html to what your parser uses to identify your character.
